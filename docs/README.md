# Switches

This module is an 8 channel mute module. It's great for muting CV signals, though audio signals can be muted too. All that's needed is 16 jacks and 8 toggle switches.

# Mult

This is probably the simplest module you can build and only requires 8 jacks. It can be wired up to combine/split signals in any way, though I typically go with 2 banks of 4. Note that best practice is to use buffered mults for pitch CV signals and mixers for mixing, but buffered muults are great for splitting triggers and non critical CV values.
